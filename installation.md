## Download

The new Companion is a ground-up rewrite, so needs to be downloaded and flashed to an SD card. 
It is compatible with both **Raspberry Pi 3** and **Raspberry Pi 4**, so choose your poison.

The latest available beta image is:
- [1.0.0.beta5](https://s3.amazonaws.com/downloads.bluerobotics.com/Pi/experimental/companion-docker-14-nov-2021-1.0.0-beta5.img.zip) (14-nov-2021)

## Flash

We recommend using a fresh SD card, with at least 4GB capacity.

1. Download and install [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)
1. Insert the SD card to your computer (you may need an SD card reader)
1. Open Etcher, select the image you just downloaded, and flash it onto the SD card

## Run

1. Eject your SD card with the new Companion software
1. Insert it into your Raspberry Pi, and power it up!

The first boot may take a couple of minutes, as it expands the filesystem to the new SD card capacity. It should take around 2 minutes for a 16GB class 10 SD card.
