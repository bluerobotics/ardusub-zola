A depth-rated electrical switch allows turning a circuit in an enclosure on and off from outside the enclosure. It can be used
* to prevent unintentional arming of the vehicle
* for disconnecting power to the control electronics to reduce idle power usage
* for sending a signal to the electronics (e.g. to activate a programming / communication mode)

## Supported Electrical Switches

* [Blue Robotics Switch](https://bluerobotics.com/store/comm-control-power/switch/switch-10-5a-r1/)

## Other Known Switch Types

* Reed Switch
   * The switch component sits on the inside of the enclosure wall / end cap, and a magnet can be put on or removed from the other side to open/close the switch circuit
