Acoustic modems enable wireless data transmission through water. With two omni-directional transceivers, bidirectional communication is possible. 

In theory it is possible to use acoustic modems for wireless synchronisation of an autonomous swarm of underwater vehicles.

## Supported Acoustic Modems

The following acoustic modems have been tested:
